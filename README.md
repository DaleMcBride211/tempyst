# Tempyst

## Overview

Tempyst is a web application that provides real-time weather data for any location. This project was developed to deepen my understanding of **API requests**, handling large **JSON objects**, and implementing user **authentication**. It's built with a modern tech stack and is hosted on Vercel. The user interface was created using a UI library to enhance the overall design and user experience.

## Web Pages

The application has two main web pages. The **landing page** serves as an introduction to the product, similar to a real company's website. Once a user creates an account and authenticates, they are granted access to the main **weather application page**, which displays the weather data.

## Development Environment

The project was developed using the **VS Code** editor and tested locally. The application is now hosted and deployed on **Vercel**. The core technologies used include **Next.js**, **NextAuth** for user authentication, and the **shadcn/ui** library for the user interface. The entire application is written in **TypeScript**.

## Future Work

* **Improve Location Search**: The current location search can struggle with smaller towns. A future goal is to implement a more robust and accurate geocoding service.
* **Rework Authentication**: I've used different authentication libraries in other projects that offer a smoother experience. I plan to migrate from NextAuth to a more suitable alternative to improve the authentication flow.
* **Enhance UI/UX**: The user interface could be more intuitive. I want to work on the UI to make the weather data easier to read and the overall user experience more seamless.
